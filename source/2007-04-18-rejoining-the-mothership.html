I have a few friends at Sun who are working on projects that I never thought I would see at Sun. The kind of projects that I left Sun to pursue. They are excited about their work. They have a manager that gets it with a management chain that is willing to give them the flexibility that they need to be able to get the job done. Best of all, they believe that I would be a great addition to their team. They have told me so over the last few months. I finally listened. I'll be joining their team on April 23rd.

I don't know yet how much have been announced, so I'm not going to go into details about the project itself. I can say that the Sun I am going to join isn't the Sun I left. Dynamic languages are now getting public support in NetBeans as well as within Sun's management. A lot of the overhead that was frustrating me doesn't seem to be an issue any more. We are talking about a company that is excited and exciting again. Big changes have happened that I didn't thought would be possible at the time.

I am sad to leave my TransZap colleagues behind. This is a team of good people with a product that solves a big problem in their industry. I'll miss them. I'll also miss the foosball matches as well as hearing the scooter whizzing in the hallway. I wish them the best of luck and success.
