<p>
I have been working at Sun for three days now. It's really good to see old friends and colleagues. I did miss a lot of them. You can actually credit my return to the insistence of a handful of people that kept trying to convince me to return for a few months now.
</p><p>
Some things haven't changed. I am still waiting to get my account setup so I can get on SWAN and access the resources I'll need for this job. The difference is that it is going faster this time than it did before. The offices are the same, the campus feels very comfortable and familiar to me. The dining hall hasn't changed much since I left. It's strange, but I really did miss the Broomfield campus. 
</p><p>
Other things have changed. You used to be able to connect a laptop or computer to SWAN and have access to many internal web sites without challenge. Now you have to provide credentials before you can access the network. Thankfully the campus wireless network allows me to stay connected to the rest of the world while I wait for my credentials. The parking lots do seem a little emptier than they used to be.

One thing that I do love is that the team I joined is excited about the project. We are blazing new trails here at Sun and the response is very positive so far. It also helps that a lot of the red tape I used to face seems to be gone. There is indeed hope that the corporate immune system isn't going to re-assert itself like it did before. That in itself should help a lot.
