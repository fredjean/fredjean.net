<p>I have been back at Sun for almost a year now. Still, there are a few things that I have yet to take care of. Things like unsubscribing from the Sun Alumni Yahoo! group. Or moving my RSS feed back to blogs.sun.com.</p>
<p>Well, one of these things have been taken care of since I am now syndicated on blogs.sun.com instead of alumni.sun.com. It will be interesting to see how this affects my FeedBurner numbers...</p>
