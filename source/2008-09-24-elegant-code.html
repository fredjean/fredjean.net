<p>I spent some time going through the <a href="http://elegantcode.com/">Elegant Code</a> blog after <a href="http://agileartisans.com/main/blog/129">Jared blogged about his latest interview</a>. I was very impressed with the content and added it to my subscription list. I strongly recommend it to anyone who are interested in increasing the elegance and quality of the applications they write.</p>
