<p>I find this year's election very interesting as a Canadian living in Colorado. I am merely a spectator since I have yet to become an American citizen. Still, I do see this as a pivotal moment in the history of this nation. Americans get to decide what direction they want this country to take.</p>
<p>This morning, Colin Powell publicly endorsed Barack Obama. This in itself is an event in itself. He took time to explain the rationale behind his decision to vote for Obama on Meet the Press on MSNBC.com. Take a few moments to listen through the interview if you haven't already.</p>

<p>His explanation mirrors in many ways my impression of the campaign run by both candidates. It is a thought through, mindful exposition of why Obama is the better choice for President of the United States of America. Powell's rationale is very powerful and in many confirmed why I would vote for Obama if I could.</p>
