title: Groovy Unit Testing Presentation
published: true

<p>I gave a talk on Groovy Unit Testing to the <a href="http://boulderjug.org/">Boulder JUG</a> and the <a href="http://denverjug.org/">Denver JUG</a> this week. The talk was well received, and I got some helpful comments that I will certainly incorporate into future version of the talk. The talk covered:</p><ul>
<li>How to use <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> to author <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit 4</a> test cases</li>
<li>How to use closure and map coercion to mock dependencies</li>
<li>How to use JMockit to mock classes with final or static methods</li>
</ul><p>I tried something different this time. I used the <a href="http://github.com/pragdave/codex/tree/master">Codex presentation tool</a> put together by <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/">Dave Thomas</a> and <a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> to author the slides. It was a great fit since they are very code heavy. This also allowed me to version the talk and keep a copy of the source up on <a href="http://github.com/fredjean/groovyunittesting/tree/master">a github repository</a>. The tool chain generates <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5 presentations</a> which can be run in a browser.</p><p>The slides themselves are <a href="http://fredjean.net/GroovyUnitTesting">posted on my web site</a>. It certainly doesn't have the same impact as attending the presentation but there's a lot of material available and there are 2 sample NetBeans projects that illustrate the techniques that I presented on.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2472972155627143715-8770399522731411195?l=blog.fredjean.net" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
