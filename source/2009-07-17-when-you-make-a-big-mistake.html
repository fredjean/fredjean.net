title: When You Make a Big Mistake
published: true
---
<p>You can just feel the panic rising. You were logged into the production database fixing a few records when you made a small mistake with disastrous consequence.</p>
<p>So what should you do next?</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Step away from the keyboard.</p>
<p>Breath.</p>
<p>Get help.</p>
<p>Odds are that someone who isn't in a near panic state will be able to think clearly about the problem and guide you through a solution that will reduce or even remove the impact of the incident and help you get things back to their normal state.<br /></p>
<p>Of course, you should really ask yourself why you were in the production database in the first place... But that's another discussion.</p>
