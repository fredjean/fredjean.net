A developer pulls a copy of the staging database and runs a migration to
make sure that it will work against the existing data and structure.

A developer writes specs around a new feature that he is building.

Both acts imply testing. One is explicit and leaves behind testing
artifacts that can be referred to and reviewed at any time. The other is
implicit and does not leave any artifact of it occuring.

Both have value.

Do not let the BDD and TDD zealots make you believe otherwise.
